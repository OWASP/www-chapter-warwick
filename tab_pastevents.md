IMC Auditorium 002, International Manufacturing Centre Building (WMG)

We're really excited to be holding the first Warwick and Coventry OWASP Chapter meetup. We've had tremendous support already from the local Universities, local businesses, other chapters (\<3 you London), speakers, and individuals who've reached out for no other reason than to see how they can help out. So thanks\!

We're using Eventbrite solely to gauge figures for attendance - OWASP meetings are always FREE.
